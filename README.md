# WC Vendors - Aelia Currency Switcher Integration

This is a proof of concept plugin, showing how to integrate some of the WC Vendors element with the Aelia Currency Switcher. In its current state, it allows to add a currency to each vendor, which can then be used as the currency in which each vendor will enter the price of their products, as well as converting the commissions before settling them against each account.

### Examples and documentation
Please feel free to extend this plugin as you wish.
